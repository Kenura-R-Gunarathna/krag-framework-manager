Written mainly for `UBUNTU\Debian` Users only. You can modify it for other distros by replacing the `apt` command in each of them. This allows users to creat your `Laravel`, `KARCH`, and `custom websites` easily by handling the `custom domains(/etc/hosts file)`and the apache virtualization by creating a seperate `/etc/apache2/sites-available/YOUR_SITE.conf` file. All the necessary scripts will be run automatically.

Download the source code and run as :

```
sudo ./run.sh
```
